  <p>I remember the days as a kid where I could be happy without thinking about what happiness is. I need puprose. School is just a waste of time but also required by social standards. I just need sleep.</p>

  <p>....[I feel out of place as if im the moon in the sky]]..[Im the only person I can trust]].. The steady decent I have taken into madness. I dont know my own self anymore. When you start to hate waking up, why continue to do it?

  <p> I got a new computer today. Its supposed to be one of the best. Hopefully selling my tv was worth it.

  <p> My mind is like a piano. Actions are my keys. Life is a song. Hoping for a symphony yet all you get is a harmony thats suddenly ended with ruin. You cant choose your leitmotif

  <p> Today I actually felt happy to leave my bed. I wonder if anyone will ever find this. When will it start.

  <p> People say religion can make you happier. I thought about joining a religion. I dont believe in a god but if I did why would I put my faith in a being that has allowed my life to be this way.

  <p> Ive learned of a group. They go by the name "Knights of the protocol". I dont know what the protocol is but it sounds interesting. People say they have a website but the only info I have on said website is "Weird, psyche, religion, distortion, society, protocol, landscape.. Ego..PD,PT" no idea what any of it means
