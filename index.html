  <p> Ive been inspired to document my thoughts. This is where I will be myself and reveal the static black that is my mind
  
  
  <p>[Entry1]]</p>
  <p>I remember the days as a kid where I could be happy without thinking about what happiness is. I need puprose. School is just a waste of time but also required by social standards. I just need sleep.</p>

  <p>....[I feel out of place as if im the moon in the sky]]..[Im the only person I can trust]].. The steady decent I have taken into madness. I dont know my own self anymore. When you start to hate waking up, why continue to do it?

  <p> My mind is like a piano. Actions are my keys. Life is a song. Hoping for a symphony yet all you get is a harmony thats suddenly ended with ruin. You cant choose your leitmotif

  <p> Today I actually felt happy to leave my bed. I wonder if anyone will ever find this. When will it start.

  <p> Theoretically I could live forever. An artificial life is possible. I could give up my humanity and be more then a mortal. If we spend so much time digitally then why dont we become digital. If our lives are dictated by code why dont we become said code. Soon my real life will start.

  <p> People say religion can make you happier. I thought about joining a religion. I dont believe in a god but if I did why would I put my faith in a being that has allowed my life to be this way.
